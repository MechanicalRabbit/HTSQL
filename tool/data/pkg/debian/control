Description: navigational query language for relational databases
 ***********************************************************
   HTSQL -- A Query Language for the Accidental Programmer
 ***********************************************************
 .
 HTSQL ("Hyper Text Structured Query Language") is a high-level query
 language for relational databases.   The target audience for HTSQL is
 the accidental programmer -- one who is not a SQL expert, yet needs a
 usable, comprehensive query tool for data access and reporting.  
 .
 HTSQL is also a web service which takes a request via HTTP, translates
 it into a SQL query, executes the query against a relational database,
 and returns the results in a format requested by the user agent (JSON,
 CSV, HTML, etc.).
 .
 Use of HTSQL with open source databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) is
 royalty free under BSD-style conditions.  Use of HTSQL with proprietary
 database systems (Oracle, Microsoft SQL) requires a commercial license.
 See ``LICENSE`` for details.
