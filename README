HTSQL -- A Query Language for the Accidental Programmer
=======================================================

HTSQL ("Hyper Text Structured Query Language") is a schema-driven
URI-to-SQL translator that takes a request over HTTP, converts it to a
SQL query, executes the query against a database, and returns the
results in a format best suited for the user agent (CSV, HTML, etc.).

Use of HTSQL with open source databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) is
royalty free under BSD-style conditions.  Usage of HTSQL with
proprietary database systems (Oracle, Microsoft SQL) requires a
commercial license.  See ``LICENSE`` for details.

For installation instructions, see ``INSTALL``.  For list of new
features in this release, see ``NEWS``.  HTSQL documentation is in the
``doc`` directory.
