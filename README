HTSQL - A Query Language for the Accidental Programmer
======================================================

HTSQL is a schema-driven URL-to-SQL translator that takes a request over
HTTP, converts it to a SQL query, executes the query against a database,
and returns the results in a format best suited for the user agent (CSV,
HTML, etc.).  HTSQL requests are shorter and easier to read than their SQL
equivalents.  They allow users to do many of the things they could do with
SQL, but without the risks and complications of unrestricted database
access.
